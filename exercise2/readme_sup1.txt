The plot shows that the pendulum's behaviour diverges quite early - about 40 seconds after beginning oscillation,
for a 0.00001 difference in initial angle.

Even though in the previous task it said to leave the damping as 0.5, there is no divergent behaviour under that condition
because the oscillations quickly become sine waves with the same period and a slight phase difference.
