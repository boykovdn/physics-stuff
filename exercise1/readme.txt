The exercise went generally okay, I didn't fully understand what I needed to show with the phase plot, you can find the result as figure_phase_pattern.png

figure_1.png could probably show more clearly that the data goes as 1/sqrt(N), and I thought about fitting a function to illustrate this, but then got lost in details, so I just said if you transform it, you get a straight line => should be 1/sqrt(N).

I tried to use vectorization together with lambda expressions, which seemed to simplify the code, although it might be less readable. Sorry!
